PROBLEM: How to break while loop from continous keypress
continuously while loop gathering data
need to have a while loop to continously keypress button 
while while loop is happening data isnt being gathered 
have to continuously check value of 'value' but
possible until function is called again. 
might need to not have this in a function
just have these calls happen each time the device gathers data
while loop would still cause an issue

Solution 1?
get rid of function then,
while flag == 1:w
    keypress of W
    new_x, new_z = process_data(data)
    if new_x falls between threshold:
        keypress release
        flag = 0
